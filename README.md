## Arun Atchuthananthan 🇨🇦 
#### Student 📖, Software Developer 🧑‍💻, and Problem Solver 🧠

Hey, I'm Arun and this is a catalogue of some of my explorations in software development! 

Currently, I'm in my third year pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science (BCS) with a Specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Waterloo. 

I'm 21 years old and have been coding for more than half of of my life. I began coding as a means to solve interesting problems, from programming robots to coding competitions. This passion has continued, but I now focus my skills on creating software that creates immediate positive impacts on users. Thus, the majority of my personal experiences relate to web and mobile application development. I am also actively exploring Artifical Intelligence, cloud computing, and financial technologies through academic and extracurricular projects.

While focusing my academic work towards artifical intelligence and more rigorous computer science concepts, I am supplementing my learning through software internships at companies such as Infor, Innovapost, and AlertDriving. I continue to look for opportunities to apply and expand my skillset in a professional setting.
